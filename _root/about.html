                    <p>
                        Aside from co-owning and operating the PhotoStache photo booth, Roy is also a Registered Dietitian who works closely with renal patients.  He strives to improve their lives by helping them make healthy lifestyle choices.  When he’s not working, Roy enjoys watching sports (Go Lakers! Dodgers! AND KINGS! YEA BABYY!!!!) and physical activities such as hiking and working out at the gym. He’s also a great Fan Duel player.  He lives by the quote “A day without laughter is a day wasted” and always enjoys having a good time.

                    <h2>Andrew Lee, Founder</h2>
                    <p>
                        When he's not being the best photo booth attendant (in the whole wide world), Andrew is a Golf Professional/instructor and helps others perfect the game of golf. His interests include cooking, traveling, fishing, being a foodie, photography, shopping online, and of course, playing golf. Andrew's goal is to provide a fun, unique, and memorable experience for those planning their events. He wants to bring more than just a photo into people's lives, but also give them something they can hold on to forever.
