                        <p><span>A: </span> Here's the truth. We've been to many events where we've had the opportunity to snap our pictures using a photobooth. At times we were impressed with the quality of the photo and other times we were truly disappointed. We believe in quality. We want our customers to leave a lasting positive impression on our service and product. We want to capture a fun and memorable moment at your event. We utilize a DSLR camera, professional lighting, easy-to-use touch screen, dye-sub printer that prints in under 10 seconds, an abundance of fun props, as well as working closely with our clients to provide fully customized layouts to match their special event. We want you to end the night knowing that everything you got was well worth the research in finding the perfect photobooth for your event.</p>
